[00:42.77] Time came to leave
[00:45.05] You know there's something
[00:47.09] about the principle of what goes on behind the scenes
[00:51.28] The military machine
[00:53.03] The way they led me on
[00:58.26] Stiletto in the sand
[01:00.50] Thrusted down in anger
[01:02.47] Bloody to the handle
[01:04.78] Diamond red
[01:06.51] Machines of mass destruction
[01:08.57] Well, I helped to design them
[01:10.80] The guilt of children's blood stains on my hands
[01:14.56] The word from the board room
[01:18.54] Our boys in Tehran have scored
[01:26.25] How long â€˜till we realize the truth?
[01:30.07] The bottom line of defense and world security
[01:34.47] The bankers and the ministry of arms
[01:37.94] Just cut the deal and the war is on
[01:42.87] The village burned the desert set ablaze
[01:46.47] Who are these men with their fingers in everybody's pie?
[01:50.68] Big rockets and their profiles all the rage
[01:53.73] Their business plan calls for war for sale
[02:15.93] Please understand
[02:18.88] Until I saw all this
[02:21.26] I never thought about the Third World trampled under wheels
[02:25.42] Out in the streets and in the fields
[02:27.57] I simply questioned it all
[02:32.42] Stiletto in the sand
[02:34.66] Fingers on the triggers
[02:36.80] Tempers boiling over
[02:38.87] Bleed them red
[02:40.83] Machines of mass destruction
[02:42.66] Oh, why did I design them?
[02:44.76] The guilt of children's blood stains on my hands
[02:48.71] Napalm and land mines
[02:52.59] Nobody left alive
[03:00.13] How long 'til we realize the truth?
[03:03.92] The bottom line of defense and world security
[03:08.77] The bankers and the ministry of arms
[03:12.02] Just cut the deal and the war is on
[03:16.63] The market screams a recommended buy
[03:20.04] The contract's in - Don't just sit there, get your broker on the line
[03:24.53] Big money left their morals far behind
[03:28.09] Guess what we've got - we got war for sale!
[04:50.79] How long 'til we realize the truth?
[04:54.89] The bottom line of defense and world security
[04:59.56] The bankers and the ministry of arms
[05:02.96] Just cut the deal and the war is on
[05:07.63] The village burned, the desert set ablaze
[05:10.84] Who are these men with their fingers in everybody's pie?
[05:15.94] Then freedom's ring departed from today
[05:19.62] There's just no doubt - we got war for sale!
[05:25.17]
